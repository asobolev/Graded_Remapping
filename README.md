# Graded_Remapping

Python code to analyze data and create figures for the manuscript "Graded Remapping of Hippocampal Ensembles under Sensory Conflicts"

The data can be found at: https://gin.g-node.org/dfetterhoff/Graded_Remapping

It can be downloaded using the GIN CLI: https://gin.g-node.org/G-Node/Info/wiki/GIN+CLI+Setup

You can then download the dataset from a terminal with 'gin get dfetterhoff/Graded_Remapping'

All code was verified to work in Python 3.8.1 and 3.7.3.

We recommend using Anaconda to manage virtual environments: https://www.anaconda.com/

After installing Python, you can run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' in a terminal to install all the dependencies.
